# MacroMedia(HackPad)

## Introduction

Hello viewers this project was created by watching and learning how to make a macropad by [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/) , An event organised by [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com/). With the teachings i created **MacroMedia** which controls all your media with just one click, based on XIAO RP2040 MCU. Enjoy :)

- And Thank you for Reading?

### Challenges
Never thought i would rage quite while i'm building something interesting, my potato(Yeah that's the name of my laptop) was like a heater when i was using CAD Software, i literally tried 5 software checking which worked the smoothest and none worked then shifted too browser based onshape tool which at the end atleast worked properly. Time to change my potato ðŸ˜‚

**I wasn't able to merge them together my potato laptop was already lagging too much and taking away all my time. Hope you understand. Dimensions have been checked.**
(If need a video of me building this 3D model you ask me, it's quite funny lol. )
